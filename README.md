A reddit-like upvoting scheme based on Ethereum

#### What is this?
**What it's supposed to be:** A comment incentivization DAPP. Here
is the idea:

1. Users post things--articles, comments, etc.
2. Users can upvote or downvote the content.
3. *The "secret sauce":* To upvote or downvote, you have to **suspend Ether**
for a set amount of time. The more Ether, and the longer you suspend it, the
more weight your upvote or downvote gets. So, if you care about an article,
you can push it's ranking up by a lot.
4. Enjoy better rankings because trolls fear commitment. <3

**What it is:** Something I hacked together just for fun

#### What is complete?
The UI prototype was basically finished. The backend Solidity contract has quite a lot of 
work to be done.

#### When will it be done?
Possibly never. I have some other projects that are more pressing.

#### Why should you care?
Good question.
